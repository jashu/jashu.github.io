      <description>This post documents the key analyses reported in the article &amp;ldquo;Acetaminophen Enhances the Reflective Learning Process&amp;rdquo; by Rahel Pearson, Seth Koslov, Bethany Hamilton, Jason Shumake, Charles S. Carver, and Christopher G. Beevers. It is written from my perspective as a co-author who was not involved in designing or conducting the study but was consulted after it was finished to help with the data analysis.</description>
