I’d say the programming experience for the majority of our psychology students is acquired in a pretty haphazard, piecemeal fashion—usually by learning whatever R they need to know to make it through their statistics coursework and complete their research projects.1 So they invariably end up missing some critical “bits” (pardon the pun) of knowledge.","tags":null,"title":"When 0.1 + 0.2 Does Not Equal 0.3","type":"post","url":"/post/comparing_decimal_values/","weight":0,"wordcount":1101},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1547510400,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547510400,"objectID":"a2936fa617eb9942b7fd7726a7b7f181","permalink":"https://jashu.github.io/post/pvalues1/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/post/pvalues1/","section":"post","summary":"I know, yet another post tut-tutting the misuse of p-values.
